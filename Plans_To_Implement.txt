things to add:
1. After taking all the images during a leaf scan, allow the user to manually adjust the images prior to stitching. This way we can fix the y axis alignment issue. So before the auto stitching, give the user a choice to review their images and can adjust there y positioning before the stitch, then click confirm to continue stitching all the images together.

2. Allow different stitching positions, leaf can pulled from the right side which will require the opposite stitching style as of right now. 
	-furthermore, the leaf can be pushed into the device tip going in on the left or right. we need settings for these 4 stitching orientation.

3. Allow choice in AI models, include claude api and chatgpt api, selection of premade prompts for user to choose from. The prompts will have a simple description for the user to see, but the actually prompt will be extremely detailed, created by us to get the best diagnosis.

4. Ask for help adding additional features, like the light diffusion level detection, what the focal distance is? can the app detect how far the leaf is from its camera? 

5. Brainstorm how the app can have another automatic scanning method where the user just needs to pull leaf through device and app will automatically scan and stitch a whole corn leaf pano image.
